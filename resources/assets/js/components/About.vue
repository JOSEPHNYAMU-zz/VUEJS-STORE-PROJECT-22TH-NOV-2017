            <div style="text-align: justify;">
                The firm was formed by a team that had worked together as the executive team
                at a leading asset manager in the region. After a very successful tenure growing
                profitability by over 10 times, increasing assets by over 3 times and moving the previous
                firm from number 6 to number 1 (in the East-African region) by revenues, the team moved to
                create an independent firm focused solely on serving the interests of clients and investors.
                We strongly believe that if we wake up every day thinking about what is in the interest of clients,
                putting their interests ahead of our own and trading the short-term interests for the long-term interests,
                our clients will do very well. And when our clients do well, we will do well too.
